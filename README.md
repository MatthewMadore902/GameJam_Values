This is for our 2D lane shooter game we tried to make for a school held game jam, This code is for the score and health systems.

The score takes the score from the current game and adds it to the rankings, currently it's hooked up to add a point through a press of a button, and saves it for different times
you've played the game, through 5 different scripts it set's the UI, the saving and loading the name score and ranking.

The health system was disigned to make the player take a heart of damage everytime a sprite get to a certain size (like 180px X 180px) then dissapear, there's is a section for if we
added a way to retore the players health from enemy drops or pickups along the way, also with this script you can configure the players bullet damage.
